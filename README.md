# Bookmarks App 

A bookmark application to create, edit, and delete bookmarks. Bookmarks have titles, links, descriptions, and ratings. Bookmarks are saved on a server for up to 24 hours. An exercise on asynchronous web applications.

This application was written using AJAX, Webpack, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Make some bookmarks

Try creating, editing, or deleting [bookmarks][site]! Give a rating and/or save a description, collapse them for a simplified view or expand them for details, see them again if you close out (but be sure to come back before the server--the Thinkful project server--cleans the bookmarks out for the day), or try creating, editing, and deleting multiple bookmarks on the same page.

## User stories
As a user I want:
  - To add bookmarks that contain titles, urls, descriptions, and ratings to my bookmark list, so I can save bookmarks with the information to remember what the bookmarks are, visit their sites, and save their ratings.
  - My bookmarks to show when first opening the application, so I can find the bookmark I'm looking for or see what bookmarks I already have.
  - Bookmarks to default to a condensed view, showing only the title and rating, so I can quickly search or browse my bookmarks and their ratings.
  - To click condensed bookmarks to expand into a detailed view that contains a description and a link to visit the site, so I can easily get more information or go to the site.
  - Appropriate feedback when a bookmark cannot be submitted, so I know the bookmark was submitted correctly.
  - To filter bookmarks by a minimum rating, so I have an option to view the bookmarks I want to see.
  - To edit the ratings and descriptions, so I can update them with new ratings or information.
  - To create, edit, or delete multiple bookmarks, so I can manage multiple bookmarks and perform these operations  more quickly.
  - I want unsaved edits or bookmarks to stay when the page re-renders, so I can keep working on, submit, or cancel them.
